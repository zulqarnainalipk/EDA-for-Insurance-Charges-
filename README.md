# Insurance Charges Exploratory Data Analysis

---

Welcome to the Insurance Charges Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook! In this notebook, we will dive into the analysis of an insurance dataset to gain insights into various factors affecting insurance charges.

## Notebook Workflow Steps:

1. **Load the Necessary Libraries**
   - We begin by importing essential libraries required for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

2. **Load the Dataset**
   - We load the insurance dataset into the notebook to start our analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Shape**: We determine the dimensions of the dataset (rows, columns) to understand its size.
   - **Null Values**: Identification and handling of missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
   - **Info**: An overview of the dataset, including data types, to guide further analysis.
   - **Duplicates**: Removal of any duplicate entries to maintain data accuracy.
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of summary statistics for numerical features to understand data distribution.
   - **Outliers**: Detection and treatment of outliers to prevent skewed analysis results.
   - *Additional exploratory analysis*: Customize and add any further analysis to gain deeper insights into the dataset.
